This project explores customer satisfaction across various aspects of airline service using a relational database and Tableau dashboards. The analysis aims to provide meaningful insights into the factors affecting passenger experiences and identify key areas of improvement for airline operations.



Airline companies operate in a highly competitive and customer-centric environment where service quality directly influences customer loyalty and brand perception. This project simulates a real-world airline satisfaction dataset to explore the relationships between passenger demographics, in-flight services, flight characteristics, and overall satisfaction.

Using a relational database structure built in MySQL, I designed and populated normalized tables representing:

**Passengers**

**Flights**

**Services**

**Feedback**

Each component is connected using foreign key relationships to ensure referential integrity and enable powerful cross-table analytics. The dataset reflects realistic variations in age, class of travel, service ratings, and delay patterns, allowing for a deeper, business-relevant investigation into operational efficiency and service effectiveness.

The final dataset was analyzed in Tableau, producing an interactive dashboard that tells a compelling story:

Which services correlate most strongly with satisfaction?

How do delays impact customer happiness?

Which customer segments are most satisfied or at risk?

These visual insights can empower airline decision-makers to:

Prioritize investment in high-impact services like WiFi or comfort.

Strategize service offerings by age group or ticket class.

Reduce churn by proactively targeting dissatisfaction drivers.

This end-to-end project showcases key data skills:

Data modeling and normalization

SQL scripting for data insertion and transformation

Excel cleanup and formatting

Tableau storytelling through KPIs, heatmaps, filters, and drill-downs

It’s a practical demonstration of how data can drive value in a customer-facing industry.


 Objectives

- Models a normalized airline customer feedback database using MySQL.
- Populate tables with mock yet realistic data using SQL.
- Use Tableau to visualize satisfaction scores across key demographics and service features.
- Analyze trends such as satisfaction by class, age group, flight distance, delay impact, etc.

Database Schema

The relational database consists of the following tables:

- **Passengers** — ID, Name, Age, Gender, Class
- **Flights** — Flight ID, Origin, Destination, Distance, Departure/Arrival Delay
- **Services** — Inflight WiFi, Food, Seat Comfort, Cleanliness, etc.
- **Feedback** — Satisfaction score (0/1), Comments, Flight ID, Passenger ID

All tables are normalized and linked via foreign keys.

Technologies Used

- **MySQL** – Data modeling, table creation, complex queries.
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.
- **SQL** – For data insertion, joins, grouping, and analysis queries.

Key Insights from Tableau Dashboard

- **Business class passengers** report the highest satisfaction across most services.
- **Inflight WiFi service** and **on-time performance** are the most influential drivers of dissatisfaction.
- Older passengers tend to rate services more favorably than younger ones.
- **Flight delays** (departure/arrival) significantly correlate with low satisfaction scores.
